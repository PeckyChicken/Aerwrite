# Aerwrite
Aerwrite is a notepad, designed with fluidity in mind.

The end goal of this project is a notepad allowing you to save ideas and notes the moment you think about them. No need to spend time searching for the notepad, no need to create a new file, no need to think about where to save the file to.<br>
Everything should be done for you in the moment, and you can correct any assumptions made afterwards.

Features already implemented include:
- Automatic lists
- Automatic titling when saving
- Keyboard control
- Command-line new notes (`aerwrite --new`)
- Automatic indentation
- Automatic stripping of whitespace
